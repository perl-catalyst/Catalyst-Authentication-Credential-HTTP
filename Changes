   - Rename to remove Plugin from namespace. This is a pretty breaking change,
     as lots of things work differently with the new auth refactor.
   - Pull out some functionality which I think is better in other 
     modules (realms/stores). With the auth refactor, this module didn't need
     to do so much. If anyone misses any of the functionality, please yell at
     me and I'll put it back.
