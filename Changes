1.005  2008-09-25
  - Added better description of the use of the domains and
    use_uri_for options (info culled from RFC2617).
  - Split init method out to make this module easier to sub-class
    (used by Catalyst::Authentication::HTTP::Proxy).

1.004  2008-09-12
   - Add tests for use_uri_for configuration options.
   - Add tests and documentation for storing an MD5
     of "$user:$relam:$password" instead of cleartext password
     when doing digest auth.

1.003  2008-09-11
   - Add ability to override the realm name presented for authentication
     when calling $c->authenticate. Documentation and tests for this.
   - Clean up documentation of options inherited from 
     Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password.
   - Added an example of calling methods in the credential module from a 
     controller to the POD.
   - Tests for the authorization_required_message configuration parameter. 
   - Document use_uri_for configuration option
   - Document domain option (passed through from $c->authenticate) and add 
     tests for this option.

1.002  2008-09-03
   - Fix the assumptions that the password field is named password when doing 
     digest auth.

1.001  2008-09-02
   - Fix some of the assumptions about the user class by inheriting from the
     Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password module. This should make
     using DBIC as a store work correctly for basic auth.
   - Updated synopsis and todo list, this module still needs some work before
     it's ready for prime time again..

1.000  2008-09-01
   - Rename to remove Plugin from namespace. This is a pretty breaking change,
     as lots of things work differently with the new auth refactor.
   - Pull out some functionality which I think is better in other 
     modules (realms/stores). With the auth refactor, this module didn't need
     to do so much. If anyone misses any of the functionality, please yell at
     me and I'll put it back.

0.11  2008-07-12
    - Changed cache modules used in the tests to not be deprecated.
    - Fix RT#31036, and comply with RFC2617 Section 1.2.

0.10  2007-04-26
    - switch to Module::Install

0.09  2006-12-31
    - clean up tests
    - clean up docs
    - add body to 401 status

0.08  2006-10-12
    - Fix basic test when using Test::MockObject 1.07 (die if using undefined
      interfaces)

0.07  2006-09-12
    - Applied Ton Voon's patch that fixed option propagation for basic auth.

0.06  2006-09-07
    - Refactored internals into smaller methods
